First( < Assignment > ) = { VARIABLE }
First( < Expression > ) = First ( < Term > )
First( < Term > ) = First( < Factor > )
First( < Factor > ) = First( < Exponent > )
First( < Exponent > ) = { LPAREN, VARIABLE,
                          INTLIT, FLOATLIT }
First( < Input > ) = { INPUT }

- Problem: The first of < Assignment > and
   < Expression > have an overlap VARIABLE

- Solution: A combination of substitution and 
   refactoring of the rules.

Cleanup: remove any unreachable rules
